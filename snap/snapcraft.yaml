  Home Assistant is able to track and control all devices at home and offer a
  platform for automating control.

  Featured integrations

  The system is built using a modular approach so support for other devices or
  actions can be implemented easily. See also the `section on architecture
  <https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/en/architecture_index.html>`__ and
  the `section on creating your own components
  <https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/en/creating_component_index.html>`__.

  If you run into issues while using Home Assistant or during development of a
  component, check the `Home Assistant help section
  <https://home-assistant.io/help/>`__ of our website for further help and
  information.
